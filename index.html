            <h3>About "Me"</h3>
            <p>I am Mwagiru. I really love associating with that name since my first name is 'common' and everything about me is unique! After highschool, I joined a local University to pursue a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. If you ask me why Computer Science, I will probably have no answer. My grades were enough for the course and I thought, why not? Plus I had seen Riley from the show 'Macgyver' put her great skills to work(I mean, they had to get her from prison because she was the only one who could solve the problem fast). Wouldn't hurt to be that good, right? After joining University, my love for tech grew. I was hungry to learn. Little did i know that my love for tech would be shortlived. It is true what they say about the 8-4-4 system in Kenya-definitely not the best. We would mostly do theoretical work and not much of actual coding. Don't get me wrong-I know that theory is important but I really wanted to sharpen my practical skills. There entered Moringa. During my first year in campus, some mentors from Moringa came to my school and talked about tech(I remember them mentioning 5G).I was very interested and I think my love for tech grew but at the time all I was thinking was how I could not delay my graduation date by deferring. Fast-forward to my third year in school when I actually realized that in this field of tech, you need to know your stuff.It doesn't matter whether you have a degree or not,If you have <mark>NO</mark> skills, that's basically career suicide. I joined Moringa because I need the skills of a software developer and the overall skills required in the job market. I cannot wait to be a <strong>REALLY</strong> cool <em>Software Engineer</em><br>
                I am an Introvert but very adventurous. I love travelling,cooking and music. Also anything Marvel or with Ryan Reynolds, MARK ME PRESENT!<p>
